**Medium**

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.





Example 1:

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1

```

Example 2:

```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

```

Example 3:

```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1

```



Note:

You can assume that

- 0 <= amount <= 5000 
- 1 <= coin <= 5000 
- the number of coins is less than 500 
- the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

**中等**

给定不同面额的硬币和一个总金额。写出函数来计算可以凑成总金额的硬币组合数。假设每一种面额的硬币有无限个。





**示例 1:** 

```
输入: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
输出: 4
解释: 有四种方式可以凑成总金额:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1

```

**示例 2:** 

```
输入: amount = 3, coins = [2]
输出: 0
解释: 只用面额2的硬币不能凑成总金额3。

```

**示例 3:** 

```
输入: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
输出: 1

```



**注意** **:** 

你可以假设：

- 0 <= amount (总金额) <= 5000 
- 1 <= coin (硬币面额) <= 5000 
- 硬币种类不超过 500 种 
- 结果符合 32 位符号整数
