# [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence][enTitle]

**Hard**

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O( *n* ) complexity.

**Example:** 

```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

```


# [128. 最长连续序列][cnTitle]

**困难**

给定一个未排序的整数数组，找出最长连续序列的长度。

要求算法的时间复杂度为  *O(n)* 。

**示例:** 

```
输入: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
输出: 4
解释: 最长连续序列是 [1, 2, 3, 4]。它的长度为 4。
```
