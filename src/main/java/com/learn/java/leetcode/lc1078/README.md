# [1078. Occurrences After Bigram][enTitle]

**Easy**

Given words  *first*  and  *second* , consider occurrences in some  *text*  of the form " *first second third* ", where  *second*  comes immediately after  *first* , and  *third*  comes immediately after  *second* .

For each such occurrence, add " *third* " to the answer, and return the answer.



**Example 1:** 

```
Input:text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
Output: ["girl","student"]
```


**Example 2:** 

```
Input:text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
Output: ["we","rock"]
```



**Note:** 

1.  *1 <= text.length <= 1000*  
2.  *text*  consists of space separated words, where each word consists of lowercase English letters. 
3.  *1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10*  
4.  *first*  and  *second*  consist of lowercase English letters.




# [1078. Bigram 分词][cnTitle]

**简单**

给出第一个词  *first*  和第二个词  *second* ，考虑在某些文本  *text*  中可能以 " *first second third* " 形式出现的情况，其中  *second*  紧随  *first*  出现， *third*  紧随  *second*  出现。

对于每种这样的情况，将第三个词 " *third* " 添加到答案中，并返回答案。



**示例 1：** 

```
输入：text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
输出：["girl","student"]

```

**示例 2：** 

```
输入：text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
输出：["we","rock"]

```



**提示：** 

1.  *1 <= text.length <= 1000*  
2.  *text*  由一些用空格分隔的单词组成，每个单词都由小写英文字母组成 
3.  *1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10*  
4.  *first*  和  *second*  由小写英文字母组成
