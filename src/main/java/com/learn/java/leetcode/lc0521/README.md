# [521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I][enTitle]

**Easy**

Given two strings  *a*  and  *b* , find the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence**  between them.

A subsequence of a string  *s*  is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from  *s* . For example,  *"abc"*  is a subsequence of  *"aebdc"*  because you can delete the underlined characters in  *"aebdc"*  to get  *"abc"* . Other subsequences of  *"aebdc"*  include  *"aebdc"* ,  *"aeb"* , and  *""*  (empty string).

An **uncommon subsequence**  between two strings is a string that is a **subsequence of one but not the other** .

Return  *the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between a and b* . If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return  *-1* .



**Example 1:** 

```
Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.

```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".

```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
Output: -1
Explanation: Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a.

```



**Constraints:** 

-  *1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100*  
-  *a*  and  *b*  consist of lower-case English letters.


# [521. 最长特殊序列 Ⅰ][cnTitle]

**简单**

给你两个字符串，请你从这两个字符串中找出最长的特殊序列。

「最长特殊序列」定义如下：该序列为某字符串独有的最长子序列（即不能是其他字符串的子序列）。

**子序列**  可以通过删去字符串中的某些字符实现，但不能改变剩余字符的相对顺序。空序列为所有字符串的子序列，任何字符串为其自身的子序列。

输入为两个字符串，输出最长特殊序列的长度。如果不存在，则返回 -1。



**示例 1：** 

```
输入: "aba", "cdc"
输出: 3
解释: 最长特殊序列可为 "aba" (或 "cdc")，两者均为自身的子序列且不是对方的子序列。
```

**示例 2：** 

```
输入：a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
输出：3

```

**示例 3：** 

```
输入：a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
输出：-1

```



**提示：** 

1. 两个字符串长度均处于区间  *[1 - 100]*  。 
2. 字符串中的字符仅含有  *'a'~'z'*  。
